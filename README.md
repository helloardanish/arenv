### A testing management system for working employee in any organization to keep track of when he/she can deploy and test the code when lot of employees are working together.

As we know we work as a team sometimes it is very challenging to sync up through messages over any app to know when he/she can test once the other user has completed testing.

The scope in not only in testing but in various aspects it can be used like when you have access some information using superuser but you know superuser will be used by a lot of members so you have to wait till the user has completed their work.

To remove friction in these challenges very small system designed to keep track of availablity of testing or accessing information from a single place.



#### Step 1: New user can add the name/email/or other information and details which they will be working on with estimated time

###### It is the early stage so it can be hosted in a shared server(like Google Cloud/ Azure/AWS) and all the user can access and add their details. In upcoming days, integration will be done with backend to prevent data loss on reload or expired session.
